	I'm just a poor wayfaring stranger
	I'm traveling through this world of woe
	Yet there's no sickness, toil nor danger
	In that bright land to which I go
	I'm going there to see my mother/father
	I'm going there no more to roam
	I'm only going over Jordan
	I'm only going over home
      </p>
      <p>
	I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
	I know my way is rough and steep
	Yet golden fields lie just before me
	Where God's redeemed shall ever sleep
	I'm going there to see my father/mother
	S/he said he'd/she'd meet me when I come
	I'm only going over Jordan
	I'm only going over home
      </p>
      <p>
	I want to wear a crown of glory
	When I get home to that good land
	I want to shout salvation's story
	In concert with the blood-washed band
	I'm going there to meet my Saviour
	To sing his praise forever more
	I'm just a going over Jordan
	I'm just a going over home
